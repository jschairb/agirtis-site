## Dependencies

- java 1.7+
- [boot][1]

You'll probably want to have two terminals open in your project's
directory.

1. Start the auto-compiler.

    ```bash
    $ boot watch hoplon
    ```

2. Open the compiled html file.

    ```bash
    $ cd resources/public

    ```

3. There is no step 3; you're done.
